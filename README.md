# Procedural FPS Zombie Survival Game

A personal passion project developed solo by Alexander Ohlsson, [MrChooseNone](https://github.com/MrChooseNone). This game is a first-person shooter set in a dynamically generated cityscape where no two playthroughs are alike.

## Procedural World Generation from Real-World Data

The core feature of this project is the **procedural generation of cities and environments using OpenStreetMap (OSM) data**. By leveraging geographic data from any location on Earth, the game reconstructs realistic layouts of streets, buildings, and environments to create a survival experience tailored to your own hometown—or anywhere else in the world.

- **Real-world city layouts** rendered directly into the game
- **Dynamic placement of roads, buildings, and terrain** from OSM data
- **Immersive zombie survival gameplay** in familiar urban environments

## Gameplay Overview

- First-person shooter mechanics focused on survival and exploration
- Navigate and scavenge procedurally generated cities.
- Adaptive AI enemies (zombies) that respond to the environment
- Support for different world seeds and locations for replayability

## Built With

- **Unity** – Game engine
- **C#** – Scripting and game logic
- **Visual Studio Code** – Development environment
- **OpenStreetMap** – World data source
-  **Mapzen** – World terrain source


## Current Status

This project is in active development.

## Goals

- Expand procedural generation to include indoor layouts and landmarks
- Implement survival mechanics (inventory, crafting, etc.)
- Support multiplayer co-op in real-world-inspired maps

## About the Developer

This is a solo-developed passion project aiming to combine technical exploration with creative game design. I’m building this to push the boundaries of what’s possible with real-world data in procedurally generated gameplay.
